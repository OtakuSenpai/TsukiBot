###TsukiBot - A hand made C++ IRC bot!

This bot is my second attempt at making a C++ IRC bot. Currently this bot joins a channel on Freenode and accepts commands to
join additional channels.

I plan to make a plugin system for this bot to do things like show weather,make jokes or serve tea,mock someone,sing songs 
at the appropriate moments,etc.
