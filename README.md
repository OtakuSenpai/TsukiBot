[TsukiBot](https://github.com/OtakuSenpai/TsukiBot) is my second attempt at making a C++ IRC bot. Currently this bot joins a channel on Freenode and accepts commands to join additional channels,ping others plus give coffee,and ofc moo!!!

I plan to make a plugin system for this bot to do things like show weather,make jokes or serve tea,do some AI shit,remind people of things,google,show youtube links,give the appropriate description of links,sing songs at the appropriate moments,etc.
As they say,one at a time ðŸ˜‰

For compiling, see [Compile.md](https://github.com/OtakuSenpai/TsukiBot/blob/master/Compile.md)

Notes
-----

1) The main code of the bot is ready, I just have to implement the plugins now. The windows side of the plugin syustem is not fixed for now.
2) Don't use the compile.sh script to compile,use cmake. That script is way outdated. Though the gdb-compile.sh script uses cmake to do the dirty job.
3) This bot was only meant to be used on the Freenode network. Additional servers,if required,will be added in later versions.
4)Windows build is not fixed yet, Compile.md might be wrong.
5) More will be added on notice. ðŸ˜œ
